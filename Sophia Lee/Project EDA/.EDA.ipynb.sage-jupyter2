Unlike paralysis, individuals with paresis still have some control over the affected muscles. Paresis occurs due to nerve damage, which can be caused by a variety of factors or conditions. Paresis refers to a condition in which muscle movement has become weakened or impaired. A vast network of nerves controls the movement of the muscles in our bodies. If a part of this network is damaged, muscles in the affected area may not work properly. There are several factors that can cause paresis, and there are many different types of paresis. Paresis is often categorized by the area of the body that’s impacted. Paresis is characterized by muscle weakness. A person with paresis can still move the affected muscle or muscles. However, these movements are weaker than normal. You may also see paresis used as a suffix to distinguish what part of the body is affected. For example, a person with monoparesis has muscle weakness affecting one limb.\n# Alopecia is a disease that happens when the immune system attacks hair follicles and causes hair loss. Hair follicles are the structures in skin that form hair. While hair can be lost from any part of the body, alopecia areata usually affects the head and face. Hair typically falls out in small, round patches about the size of a quarter, but in some cases, hair loss is more extensive. Most people with the disease are healthy and have no other symptoms. The course of alopecia areata varies from person to person. Some have bouts of hair loss throughout their lives, while others only have one episode. Recovery is unpredictable too, with hair regrowing fully in some people but not others. There is no cure for alopecia areata, but there are treatments that help hair grow back more quickly. Anyone can have alopecia areata. Men and women get it equally, and it affects all racial and ethnic groups. The onset can be at any age, but most people get it in their teens, twenties, or thirties. When it occurs in children younger than age 10, it tends to be more extensive and progressive. If you have a close family member with the disease, you may have a higher risk of getting it, but for many people, there is no family history. Scientists have linked a number of genes to the disease, which suggests that genetics play a role in alopecia areata. Many of the genes they have found are important for the functioning of the immune system. People with certain autoimmune diseases, such as psoriasis, thyroid disease, or vitiligo, are more likely to get alopecia areata, as are those with allergic conditions such as hay fever. It is possible that emotional stress or an illness can bring on alopecia areata in people who are at risk, but in most cases, there is no obvious trigger. There are three main types of alopecia areata: Patchy alopecia areata. In this type, which is the most common, hair loss happens in one or more coin-sized patches on the scalp or other parts of the body.Alopecia totalis. People with this type lose all or nearly all of the hair on their scalp. Alopecia universalis. In this type, which is rare, there is a complete or nearly complete loss of hair on the scalp, face, and rest of the body.","kernel":"ds_env","pos":3,"start":1660856662524,"state":"done","type":"cell"}
